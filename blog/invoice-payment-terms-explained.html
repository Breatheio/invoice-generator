          <strong>Common invoice payment terms:</strong> Net 30 means payment is due within 30 days. Net 15 means 15 days. "Due on Receipt" means pay immediately. "2/10 Net 30" means 2% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise full amount due in 30 days. These terms set clear expectations for when clients should pay.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Understanding payment terms is essential for managing cash flow. Let's break down each term and how to use them effectively for your business.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What Are Payment Terms?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Payment terms are the conditions under which a seller expects to receive payment from a buyer. They specify when payment is due, any discounts for early payment, and penalties for late payment. Clear payment terms reduce confusion and help you get paid on time.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Common Payment Terms Explained</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Net 30</h3>

          <strong>What it means:</strong> Payment is due 30 days from the invoice date.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Net 30 is the most common payment term in business-to-business transactions. If you invoice a client on January 1st with Net 30 terms, payment is due by January 31st.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Best for:</strong> Established business relationships, B2B transactions, larger companies with longer payment cycles.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Early Payment Discounts</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Offering a discount for early payment can incentivize clients to pay faster. These terms combine a discount with a deadline:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">2/10 Net 30</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>What it means:</strong> The client gets a 2% discount if they pay within 10 days; otherwise, the full amount is due in 30 days.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          For example, on a $1,000 invoice, the client pays $980 if paying within 10 days, or $1,000 if paying between days 11-30.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">1/10 Net 30</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>What it means:</strong> A 1% discount for payment within 10 days.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          This is a more conservative discount that still encourages early payment.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Other Payment Terms</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Cash on Delivery (COD)</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Payment is made when goods are delivered. Common in shipping and e-commerce.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Cash in Advance (CIA) / Payment in Advance (PIA)</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Full payment required before work begins or goods ship. Reduces risk for the seller.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">End of Month (EOM)</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Payment is due at the end of the month in which the invoice was issued.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Upon Completion</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Payment is due when the project or service is completed. Common for project-based work.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How to Choose the Right Payment Terms</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Consider these factors when setting payment terms:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Your Cash Flow Needs</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          If you need money quickly to cover expenses, use shorter terms like Net 15 or Due on Receipt. If your cash flow is healthy, you can afford to offer longer terms.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Industry Standards</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Some industries have standard payment terms. Research what's typical in your field and match or improve upon it.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Client Relationship</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          New clients might warrant stricter terms until trust is established. Long-term reliable clients might earn more flexible terms.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Invoice Amount</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Larger invoices might require longer payment terms, while small amounts can be due immediately.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Late Payment Policies</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          In addition to payment terms, consider including a late payment policy on your invoices:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Late fees:</strong> A percentage (e.g., 1.5% per month) or flat fee added to overdue balances</li>
          <li><strong>Interest charges:</strong> Annual interest rate applied to late payments</li>
          <li><strong>Service suspension:</strong> Work stops until payment is received</li>
          <li><strong>Collection actions:</strong> Escalation to collections after a certain period</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Always state your late payment policy clearly on the invoice. Example: "A late fee of 1.5% per month (18% annually) will be charged on all overdue balances."
        </p>

          <li>State terms clearly on every invoice</li>
          <li>Include them in contracts and proposals</li>
          <li>Use plain language - "Due in 30 days" is clearer than "Net 30" for some clients</li>
          <li>Make the due date prominent on your invoice</li>
          <li>Discuss terms with new clients before starting work</li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">What does Net 30 mean on an invoice?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Net 30 means the invoice payment is due within 30 days from the invoice date. This is one of the most common payment terms used in business, giving clients a full month to process and pay the invoice.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">What's the difference between Net 15 and Net 30?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Net 15 requires payment within 15 days of the invoice date, while Net 30 allows 30 days. Net 15 is more favorable for businesses needing faster cash flow, while Net 30 is more customer-friendly and commonly used.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">What does Due on Receipt mean?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Due on Receipt means payment is expected immediately upon receiving the invoice, typically within a few days. This term is used when businesses need immediate payment and is common for urgent orders or high-risk clients.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">How do I choose the right payment terms for my business?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Consider your cash flow needs, industry standards, and customer relationships. Businesses needing quick cash should use shorter terms like Net 15, while those wanting to be competitive may offer Net 30 or Net 45. Review your customers' typical payment cycles before deciding.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">What are common invoice payment terms besides Net 30?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Common payment terms include Net 15, Net 45, Net 60, Due on Receipt, and 2/10 Net 30 (which offers a 2% discount if paid within 10 days). Each term serves different business needs and industry practices.</p>
