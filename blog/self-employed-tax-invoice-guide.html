        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          As a self-employed individual, your invoices serve a dual purpose: getting paid and documenting income for taxes. Understanding the tax implications of invoicing helps you stay compliant, maximize deductions, and avoid surprises at tax time.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Every invoice you send is a record of income. Keep copies of all invoices for at least 7 years - the IRS can audit up to 6 years back in some cases.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">What to Include on Your Invoices</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Your legal name or business name</li>
          <li>Your address</li>
          <li>Your EIN or SSN (optional but may be required by some clients)</li>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Self-Employment Taxes</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          As a self-employed person, you're responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Self-Employment Tax (SE Tax):</strong> 15.3% (Social Security + Medicare) on net earnings</li>
          <li><strong>Income Tax:</strong> Based on your total income and tax bracket</li>
          <li><strong>State/Local Taxes:</strong> Varies by location</li>
          <li><strong>Quarterly Estimated Taxes:</strong> Due April 15, June 15, Sept 15, Jan 15</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Tracking Income from Invoices</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          For tax purposes, track:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Total invoices sent</li>
          <li>Total payments received (your actual income)</li>
          <li>Outstanding invoices (accounts receivable)</li>
          <li>Bad debts (uncollectible invoices)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          <strong>Note:</strong> Most self-employed individuals use cash basis accounting, meaning you report income when received, not when invoiced.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Common Tax Deductions for Self-Employed</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          These expenses reduce your taxable income. Keep receipts and records!
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Home Office Deduction</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          If you work from home, deduct a portion of rent/mortgage, utilities, and internet. Use the simplified method ($5/sq ft, up to 300 sq ft = $1,500 max) or actual expense method.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Business Equipment & Software</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Computer and electronics</li>
          <li>Software subscriptions</li>
          <li>Office furniture</li>
          <li>Phone (business portion)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Professional Services</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Accounting and legal fees</li>
          <li>Invoicing software</li>
          <li>Business insurance</li>
          <li>Professional memberships</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Health Insurance</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Self-employed individuals can deduct 100% of health insurance premiums for themselves and family.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Vehicle Expenses</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          For business travel: standard mileage rate (67¢/mile in 2024, 70¢/mile in 2025) or actual expenses. Keep a mileage log!
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Education & Training</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Courses, conferences, and training related to your business are deductible.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Marketing & Advertising</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Website hosting and domain</li>
          <li>Online advertising</li>
          <li>Business cards and marketing materials</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1099 Forms: What You Need to Know</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Receiving 1099s</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Clients who pay you $600+ in a year should send you a 1099-NEC by January 31. However, you must report ALL income on your tax return, even without a 1099.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Sending 1099s</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          If you pay contractors $600+ in a year, you must send them a 1099-NEC. This doesn't apply to payments made to corporations or via credit card (those are reported by the payment processor).
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Record Keeping Best Practices</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Keep all invoices organized by date and client</li>
          <li>Save receipts for all business expenses</li>
          <li>Use accounting software or spreadsheets to track income and expenses</li>
          <li>Reconcile bank statements monthly</li>
          <li>Keep records for at least 7 years</li>
          <li>Back up digital records</li>
          <li>Separate business and personal finances</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Quarterly Estimated Taxes</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          If you expect to owe $1,000+ in taxes, you must pay quarterly estimated taxes to avoid penalties:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Q1:</strong> Due April 15</li>
          <li><strong>Q2:</strong> Due June 15</li>
          <li><strong>Q3:</strong> Due September 15</li>
          <li><strong>Q4:</strong> Due January 15 (following year)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          A good rule of thumb: set aside 25-30% of each invoice payment for taxes.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">When to Get Professional Help</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Consider hiring an accountant or tax professional if:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>You're new to self-employment</li>
          <li>Your income exceeds $50,000</li>
          <li>You have complex situations (international clients, multiple businesses)</li>
          <li>You're unsure about deductions</li>
          <li>You've been audited before</li>
          <li>You want to save time and reduce stress</li>
        </ul>
