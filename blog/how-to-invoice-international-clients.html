          Working with international clients opens exciting opportunities, but invoicing across borders requires extra consideration. From currencies to taxes to payment methods, here's your complete guide to billing clients in other countries.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Choosing the Right Currency</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          One of the first decisions is which currency to use on your invoice:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Option 1: Your Local Currency</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Pros:</strong> No exchange rate risk for you, simpler accounting</li>
          <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Client bears exchange rate risk, may be confusing for them</li>
          <li><strong>Best for:</strong> When you have pricing power or many international clients</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Option 2: Client's Currency</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Easier for client, more competitive</li>
          <li><strong>Cons:</strong> You bear exchange rate risk</li>
          <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Building relationships, competitive situations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Option 3: Major International Currency (USD, EUR)</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Widely accepted, stable, easy to convert</li>
          <li><strong>Cons:</strong> May involve conversion for both parties</li>
          <li><strong>Best for:</strong> When neither party uses USD/EUR domestically</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Multi-Currency Invoicing</h3>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">International Payment Methods</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Wire Transfer (SWIFT)</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Traditional bank-to-bank transfers. You'll need to provide:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Bank name and address</li>
          <li>SWIFT/BIC code</li>
          <li>Account number (or IBAN in Europe)</li>
          <li>Your name as it appears on the account</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Fees:</strong> $15-50 per transfer<br>
          <strong>Time:</strong> 1-5 business days
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">PayPal</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Easy for clients, but fees can be high for international transactions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Fees:</strong> ~4-5% for international<br>
          <strong>Time:</strong> Instant to a few hours
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Wise (formerly TransferWise)</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Popular for international payments with better exchange rates.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Fees:</strong> ~0.5-1.5%<br>
          <strong>Time:</strong> 1-2 business days
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Credit Card</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Convenient for clients but comes with processing fees. Use Stripe or similar for international card payments.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Tax Considerations</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Do You Charge Tax?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Generally, services exported to foreign clients are zero-rated or exempt from local sales tax/VAT. However, rules vary:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>US:</strong> Sales tax typically doesn't apply to exported services</li>
          <li><strong>EU:</strong> B2B services to non-EU clients are usually VAT-exempt</li>
          <li><strong>UK:</strong> Services to overseas clients are often zero-rated</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          <strong>Important:</strong> Consult a tax professional for your specific situation. Rules depend on your location, client's location, and type of service.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Reverse Charge Mechanism (EU)</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          When invoicing EU businesses, the "reverse charge" often applies - you don't charge VAT, and the client accounts for it in their country. Include the client's VAT number and note "Reverse charge applies" on the invoice.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What to Include on International Invoices</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          In addition to standard invoice elements, include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Currency code:</strong> USD, EUR, GBP - not just the symbol</li>
          <li><strong>Your country:</strong> In your address</li>
          <li><strong>Tax ID numbers:</strong> Your VAT number if applicable</li>
          <li><strong>Client's tax ID:</strong> For B2B in certain regions</li>
          <li><strong>Full bank details:</strong> Including SWIFT code and IBAN</li>
          <li><strong>Payment instructions:</strong> Clear details on how to pay</li>
          <li><strong>Language:</strong> Consider bilingual invoices if helpful</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Managing Exchange Rate Risk</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Invoice in your currency:</strong> Shifts risk to client</li>
          <li><strong>Add a buffer:</strong> Price slightly higher to cover fluctuations</li>
          <li><strong>Set short payment terms:</strong> Less time for rates to change</li>
          <li><strong>Use forward contracts:</strong> Lock in rates for large amounts</li>
          <li><strong>Hold foreign currency:</strong> If you have recurring clients in that currency</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Payment Terms for International Clients</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Consider these factors when setting terms:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>International transfers take longer - account for this in your due dates</li>
          <li>New international clients may warrant upfront payment</li>
          <li>Time zone differences can affect communication about payments</li>
          <li>Cultural norms around payment vary by country</li>
          <li>Collecting internationally is harder if payment is very late</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Tips for Getting Paid</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Request deposits, especially for new international clients</li>
          <li>Clearly state who pays transfer fees (usually split or paid by sender)</li>
          <li>Provide multiple payment options</li>
          <li>Send invoices immediately - don't add delay to already longer payments</li>
          <li>Follow up promptly on overdue invoices</li>
          <li>Build relationships - good communication transcends borders</li>
        </ul>
