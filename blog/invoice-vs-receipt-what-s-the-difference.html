        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4"><strong>The main difference:</strong> An invoice is a payment request sent before payment is made, while a receipt is proof of payment issued after payment is received. Understanding this distinction is crucial for proper business accounting and cash flow management.</p>

<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Many business owners confuse invoices and receipts, but these two documents serve completely different purposes in your accounting workflow.
