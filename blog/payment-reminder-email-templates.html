        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Best Practices for Payment Reminders</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">1. Always Attach the Invoice</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Make it as easy as possible for clients to pay. Always attach the invoice PDF to every reminder email - don't make them search for it.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">2. Include All Payment Details</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Every reminder should include: invoice number, amount due, original due date, and clear payment instructions. Remove any barriers to payment.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">3. Keep Records</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Document every reminder you send. This creates a paper trail that's valuable if you need to escalate to collections or legal action.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">4. Stay Professional</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          No matter how frustrated you are, keep your tone professional. Aggressive emails damage relationships and rarely get better results.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">5. Offer Payment Options</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          If a client is struggling to pay, offer alternatives like payment plans. Receiving partial payment is better than none at all.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Prevent Late Payments Before They Happen</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Send invoices promptly - the sooner you invoice, the sooner you get paid</li>
          <li>Use clear payment terms and communicate them upfront</li>
          <li>Offer multiple payment methods</li>
          <li>Consider requiring deposits for large projects</li>
          <li>Set up automatic reminder systems</li>
          <li>Offer early payment discounts (e.g., 2% off if paid within 10 days)</li>
        </ul>
